<!-- I decided to do my assignment around the context of a beauty e-commerce website. My chosen action was a hover effect where users can hover over a product and information such as the product name, reviews, favourite button and "Add to cart" button will slide in. I chose this concept because when applied to the whole webiste page, the layout will appear more minimalistic and clean which gives off a more modern and trustworthy design and website. -->

<!-- Had I had more time, it would've been ideal to have this replicate an actual beauty website to get the full experience however, I think this project shows the most important functionalities of the hover action. -->
