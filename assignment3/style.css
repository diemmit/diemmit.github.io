/* This is where I used Gemini to assist me in adding in the slide effect on hover. I thought this method made more sense than the attempt I made with the javascript as it looked familiar to the css animations example we did in class for week 10. Gemini was helpful in that it explained every code and what it means and does. Even though Gemini was able to help for a lot of this part, I still couldn't get it to work at the start but then I realised I needed to add the class: slide in to each element in html for it to work. */
